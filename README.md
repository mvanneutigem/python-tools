## python-tools
For the last few days I've been learning python, here's a few tools I've made in the process

# Asset Tracking tool:

It finds all files selected in the scene and allows a user to quickly override all their paths

# LightController tool [deprecated]:
<a href="http://imgur.com/a/Vdzlp"><img src="http://imgur.com/a/Vdzlp" title="gif"/></a>
collects all the lights in the scene in one window and alows you to change color and intensity
- written using classes before I knew it was possible to directly link properties

# LightControllerV2 tool :
<a href="http://imgur.com/WS5mWv1"><img src="http://imgur.com/WS5mWv1" title="gif"/></a>
collects all the lights in the scene in one window and alows you to change visibility, color and intensity
- rewritten so now it links to the light properties directly
