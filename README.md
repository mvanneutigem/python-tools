# python-tools
For the last few days I've been learning python, here's a few tools I've made in the process

### PoseSaver tool :

Call LoadPoseSaver() to launch pose saver, 
make sure you have set up your icon path before attempting to use this script.
When you create a pose it automatically takes a screenshot of the created pose.
- Click add pose to add currently selected controllers to the saved pose
- Click load setup to load previously saved poses from file 
- Click save setup to save current poses to file
Saved setups will be saved and loaded from the folder of the open maya file

### LightControllerV2 tool :

collects all the lights in the scene in one window and alows you to change visibility, color and intensity
- rewritten so now it links to the light properties directly

### LightController tool [deprecated]:

collects all the lights in the scene in one window and alows you to change color and intensity
- written using classes before I knew it was possible to directly link properties

### Asset Tracking tool:

It finds all files selected in the scene and allows a user to quickly override all their paths


### Spiral Creation tool:
The first tool I wrote to learn python, it allows you to set up some settings and create a spiral out of spheres
