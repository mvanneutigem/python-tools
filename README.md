For the last few days I've been learning python, here's a few tools I've made in the process

Asset Tracking tool:

It finds all files selected in the scene and allows a user to quickly override all their paths

LightController tool [WIP]:

collects all the lights in the scene in one window and alows you to change color and intensity
