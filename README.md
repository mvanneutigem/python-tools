For the last few days I've been learning python, here's a few tools I've made in the process

### LightControllerV2 tool :

collects all the lights in the scene in one window and alows you to change visibility, color and intensity
- rewritten so now it links to the light properties directly

### LightController tool [deprecated]:

collects all the lights in the scene in one window and alows you to change color and intensity
- written using classes before I knew it was possible to directly link properties

### Asset Tracking tool:

It finds all files selected in the scene and allows a user to quickly override all their paths


### Spiral Creation tool:
The first tool I wrote to learn python, it allows you to set up some settings and create a spiral out of spheres
